# UNet and nnUNet Image Segmentation and Evaluation

For our project we will utilize a convolutional neural network based on UNet and nnUNet architectures to perform image segmentation on a dataset. Image segmentation involves the partitioning of images into meaningful regions, for example in medicide to visualize and segment certain tissue in the body or segment structures of a satellite image. These segmentations can help with visualizing and emphasizing important structures and segments that want to be showcased in the related image.

The goal of the project is to train and test the performance of our models on certain data and in the end, evaluate the results and assess the performance by plotting various statistics and metrics.

## Project overview

- **Implementation**: Implementing UNet and nnUNet architectures
- **Preparation**: Prepare, clean and split up data according to current needs
- **Training**: Train the models on a dataset of segmented images for accurate segmentation
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models on a new, unseen dataset and evaluating their ability to accurately segment images
- **Visualization**: Visualize the segmentation results and compare them, furthermore plotting various quantitative metrics to showcase performance. In addition plot various statistics from the datasets themselves to understand the data better so the results can be interpreted easier.

We will especially focus on the last point, as well as properly preparing the used data so we can also apply the methods learned during the lecture. 

## Setup 
(Will be add later)

## Usage 
Expected output after running the model: Visualization of segmentation results and performance metrics
