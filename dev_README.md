# Development branch "dev"
This branch often serves as the main integration branch where features are merged before being incorporated into the main branch. It's used for ongoing development work that is not yet ready to be merged into the main branch.


**"So team! Make sure to take care of the Kid Brother, the ***main branch***, by using its Big Brother, the ***dev branch*** before pushing any changes bunglingly!."**
